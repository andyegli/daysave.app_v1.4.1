- [ ] **Update database models** - Support processor-specific result structures
  - Flexible schema for processor-specific metadata
  - Migration scripts for existing data
  - Backward compatibility during transition

- [ ] **Update routes integration** - Use new orchestrator instead of MultimediaAnalyzer
  - Update content.js and files.js routes
  - Maintain API compatibility during transition
  - Add new endpoints for granular control

- [ ] **Create migration script** - Migrate existing content to new result format
  - Data transformation scripts
  - Rollback capabilities
  - Progress tracking for large datasets

- [ ] **Implement backward compatibility** - Ensure existing API endpoints work
  - Legacy endpoint wrappers
  - Gradual migration strategy
  - Feature flag controlled rollout

- [ ] **Update UI components** - Use new unified result format
  - Content card component updates
  - Analysis modal enhancements
  - Filter and search improvements

### **Phase 6: Testing & Optimization (Ongoing)**
- [ ] **Write integration tests** - Comprehensive tests for new architecture
  - Unit tests for each processor
  - Integration tests for orchestrator
  - End-to-end workflow testing

- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Optimize for performance and memory usage
  - Memory usage profiling and optimization
  - Processing pipeline optimization
  - Caching strategies implementation

## High Priority (After Refactoring)
- [ ] **Content Management Enhancements**
  - [ ] Add bulk operations for content items (select multiple, assign to groups, delete)
  - [ ] Enhance content filtering with advanced search capabilities
  - [ ] Add content export functionality (PDF, CSV)

- [ ] **File Management System**
  - [ ] Add file organization by folders/categories
  - [ ] Implement file preview capabilities for multiple formats
  - [ ] Add file sharing with expiration dates

## Medium Priority
- [ ] **UI/UX Improvements**
  - [ ] Implement responsive design optimizations for mobile
  - [ ] Add dark mode theme support
  - [ ] Enhance accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- [ ] **Security & Performance**
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting per user tier
  - [ ] Add comprehensive audit logging for all user actions
  - [ ] Optimize database queries for large datasets

## Lower Priority
- [ ] **OAuth & Authentication**
  - [ ] Add support for additional OAuth providers (LinkedIn, GitHub)
  - [ ] Implement single sign-on (SSO) capabilities

- [ ] **Analytics & Reporting**
  - [ ] Add user activity analytics dashboard
  - [ ] Implement content performance metrics
  - [ ] Add usage statistics for admin users
