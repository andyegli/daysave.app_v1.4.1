## 📝 **Recommended Import Settings**

### **Field Mapping**
```
Work Item ID → Work Item ID
Issue Type → Issue Type
Summary → Summary
Epic Name → Epic Name (for epics only)
Parent → Parent (epic ID for stories, story ID for tasks)
Description → Description
Priority → Priority
Story Points → Story Points
Labels → Labels
Components → Components
```

### **Issue Types to Enable**
```
Epic - For major feature themes
Story - For user-facing functionality  
Task - For development work/commits
```

### **Components to Create**
```
Authentication, Social Media, AI Analysis, Contacts, Sharing,
File Management, Administration, Testing, Internationalization,
Security, Integration, Mobile, Analytics
```

## 🔍 **Post-Import Verification**

### **JQL Queries to Run**
```jql
# Check all epics (should be 13)
type = Epic

# Check all stories (should be 340)
type = Story

# Check all tasks (should be 300+)
type = Task

# Verify epic-story relationships
type = Story AND parent is not EMPTY

# Verify story-task relationships  
type = Task AND parent is not EMPTY AND parent != Epic

# Check story points totals
"Story Points" is not EMPTY
```

### **Expected Hierarchy**
```
📁 Epic: Authentication & User Management (89 points)
  📄 Story: Register with email/password (3 points)
    ⚡ Task: Update passport libraries (ea7c935)
  📄 Story: Enable/disable 2FA (8 points)
    ⚡ Task: Configure WebAuthn ALLOWED_ORIGINS (0a4b731)
    ⚡ Task: Fix WebAuthn origin mismatch (abaa69d)
```
