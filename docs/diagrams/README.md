## Architecture Benefits

### ðŸ”„ Independent Processing
Each media type has its own dedicated processor, allowing modifications without affecting others.

### ðŸ”§ Granular Control
Individual processing options can be configured per job type and media format.

### ðŸŽ¨ Uniform Display
All content types use the same display interface through the ResultFormatter.

### âš¡ Performance Optimization
Parallel processing streams maximize throughput and resource utilization.

### ðŸ§© Extensibility
New media types and processing features can be easily added through the plugin system.

### ðŸ”’ Error Isolation
Failures in one processor don't cascade to others through the ErrorIsolationManager.

## Database Integration

The diagrams show integration with comprehensive database models:

- **Content Table** - URL-based content entries
- **Files Table** - Uploaded file records
- **VideoAnalysis Table** - Video-specific analysis results
- **AudioAnalysis Table** - Audio-specific analysis results
- **ImageAnalysis Table** - Image-specific analysis results
- **ProcessingJob Table** - Job tracking and progress monitoring
- **Thumbnail Table** - Generated thumbnails and key moments
- **Speaker Table** - Speaker identification and voice prints
- **Face Table** - Face detection and recognition data

## AI Services Integration

All processors integrate with advanced AI services:

- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Content summarization, sentiment analysis, tag generation
- **OpenAI Vision** - Image analysis and description generation
- **OpenAI Whisper** - Audio transcription fallback
- **Google Cloud Vision** - Object detection, OCR, face detection
