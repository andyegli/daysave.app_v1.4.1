# Generate with specific format
plantuml -tpng docs/diagrams/project-gantt-chart.puml
```

### Online Generation
1. Copy .puml file content
2. Paste into [PlantUML Online Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)

- **ASCII**: For text-based documentation inclusion

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Rendering Problems
- Ensure PlantUML syntax is correct
- Check for missing dependencies or arrows
- Verify date formats in Gantt charts
- Test with simplified version first

#### Performance Issues
- Large diagrams may take time to render
- Consider splitting complex diagrams into sections
- Use local PlantUML for better performance
- Optimize diagram complexity for readability

#### Formatting Issues
- Check color definitions and styling
- Ensure consistent spacing and alignment
- Test rendering in different formats
- Validate against PlantUML documentation
