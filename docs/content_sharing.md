# DaySave.app Content Sharing Feature - Implementation Status & Design

## **📊 Content Sharing Implementation Status**

### **🔴 Current Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED**

The Content Sharing feature is **completely unimplemented** at this time. While the database foundation exists, no functional sharing capabilities have been developed.

---

## **📋 What EXISTS (Database Foundation Only)**

### **1. Database Schema Ready**
- ✅ **`share_logs` table** exists with proper structure:
  - `user_id` (CHAR(36)) - Who is sharing the content
  - `content_id` (CHAR(36)) - URL/web content being shared
  - `file_id` (CHAR(36)) - Uploaded file being shared
  - `contact_id` (CHAR(36)) - Individual recipient
  - `group_id` (CHAR(36)) - Group recipient (contact_group or content_group)
  - `share_method` (STRING) - How content is shared (email, notification, link, etc.)
  - `language` (STRING) - Localization support
  - `createdAt`, `updatedAt` - Timestamps for tracking

### **2. Model Relationships**
- ✅ **ShareLog model** (`models/shareLog.js`) with proper associations:
  - `belongsTo` User (sharer)
  - `belongsTo` Content (shared URL content)
  - `belongsTo` File (shared uploaded file)
  - `belongsTo` Contact (recipient)

- ✅ **Contact model** has ShareLog relationship
- ✅ **Content and File models** can be linked to shares

### **3. Email Infrastructure**
- ✅ **Gmail SMTP** configured (`utils/send-mail.js`)
- ✅ **Email service** working (currently used for password reset)
- ✅ **Nodemailer transporter** with authentication

---

## **❌ What's MISSING (Everything Else)**

### **1. No User Interface**
- ❌ No sharing buttons on content items in `/content/list`
- ❌ No contact selection interface or modals
- ❌ No group sharing interface
- ❌ No sharing history view for users
- ❌ No "Shared with Me" section for recipients

### **2. No Backend Routes**
- ❌ No `POST /content/:id/share` endpoint
- ❌ No `POST /files/:id/share` endpoint
- ❌ No sharing logic in controllers
- ❌ No sharing permissions middleware
- ❌ No sharing analytics endpoints

### **3. No Notification System**
- ❌ No email templates for sharing notifications
- ❌ No in-app notification system
- ❌ No sharing confirmation emails
- ❌ No notification preferences for users

### **4. No Permission System**
- ❌ No sharing permissions (view-only, download, etc.)
- ❌ No expiration dates for shared content
- ❌ No access control for shared items
- ❌ No revocation capabilities

### **5. No Analytics & Tracking**
- ❌ No view tracking for shared content
- ❌ No access analytics dashboard
- ❌ No sharing history reports

---

## **🤔 How Would Content Sharing Work? (Planned Design)**

Based on the use cases (UC-150 to UC-159) and database schema, here's the intended workflow:

### **1. Sharing Process Flow**
```
User clicks "Share" on content item → 
Select contacts/groups from list → 
Choose sharing method (email/notification/link) → 
Add optional custom message → 
Set permissions (view-only, download, expiry) →
System creates ShareLog entry → 
Sends notification to recipients →
Tracks access and analytics
```

### **2. How Contacts Would Know About Shared Content**

#### **Option A: Email Notifications** (Most Likely Implementation)
- User shares content with contact
- System sends email to contact's email address from contacts database
- Email would contain:
  - **Subject**: "John shared content with you - [Content Title]"
  - **Link** to view the shared content (secure, authenticated)
  - **Custom message** from sender
  - **Preview/thumbnail** of content (if available)
  - **"View in DaySave"** button/link
  - **Sender information** and sharing date

#### **Option B: In-App Notifications** (If contacts are also DaySave users)
- Notification appears in recipient's dashboard
- Shows in dedicated "Shared with Me" section
- Real-time notification badge in header
- Push notifications (future mobile app)

#### **Option C: Shareable Links** (Public/External sharing)
- Generate unique, secure, time-limited link
- Send link via any method (email, SMS, messaging apps)
- Link provides temporary access to content without DaySave account
- Configurable expiration and permissions

### **3. Contact Notification Methods**

#### **For Existing DaySave Users:**
1. **In-app notification** (primary)
2. **Email notification** (backup/preference)
3. **Dashboard "Shared with Me" section**

#### **For External Contacts (Non-users):**
1. **Email with secure link** (primary method)
2. **SMS with link** (future feature)
3. **Direct shareable URL** (copy/paste)

### **2. Backend API Routes**
```javascript
// Sharing endpoints needed:
POST   /api/content/:id/share     // Share content item
POST   /api/files/:id/share       // Share file
GET    /api/shares/sent           // User's sharing history
GET    /api/shares/received       // Content shared with user
DELETE /api/shares/:id            // Revoke sharing access
PUT    /api/shares/:id            // Update sharing permissions
```

### **3. Email Templates**
- **Share Notification**: Template for notifying recipients
- **Access Granted**: Confirmation of successful sharing
- **Access Revoked**: Notification when access is removed

## **📊 Database Schema Details**

### **Current `share_logs` Table Structure**
```sql
CREATE TABLE share_logs (
  id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id CHAR(36) NOT NULL,           -- Sharer
  content_id CHAR(36),                 -- Shared URL content
  file_id CHAR(36),                    -- Shared uploaded file  
  contact_id CHAR(36),                 -- Individual recipient
  group_id CHAR(36),                   -- Group recipient
  share_method VARCHAR(255),           -- 'email', 'link', 'notification'
  language VARCHAR(255),               -- Localization
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (content_id) REFERENCES content(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (file_id) REFERENCES files(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (contact_id) REFERENCES contacts(id)
);
```

### **Additional Tables Needed**

  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- For access tracking and analytics
CREATE TABLE share_access_logs (
  id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  share_log_id CHAR(36),
  accessed_at TIMESTAMP,
  ip_address VARCHAR(45),
  user_agent TEXT,
  access_type ENUM('view', 'download'),

## **📝 Summary**

**Current Implementation Status: 0% Complete**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Database Schema | ✅ Ready | ShareLog model exists |
| Backend API | ❌ Missing | No sharing endpoints |
| Frontend UI | ❌ Missing | No sharing interface |
| Email Notifications | ❌ Missing | Infrastructure exists, templates needed |
| Permission System | ❌ Missing | No access control |
| Analytics | ❌ Missing | No tracking or reporting |

**Bottom Line**: The foundation exists with proper database schema and email infrastructure, but **no actual sharing functionality** has been implemented. This is essentially a planned feature with database support but requires complete development of user interface, backend logic, and notification systems.

**Priority**: Currently **not in active development** based on TODO.md priorities. Would require dedicated development sprint to implement even basic sharing capabilities.
