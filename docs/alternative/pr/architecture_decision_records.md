## Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Guide

Document significant technical decisions so future contributors understand the context, trade‑offs, and impact. Use this guide to create consistent, high‑signal ADRs.

### When to write an ADR
- **New or changed architecture**: frameworks, libraries, service boundaries, data model changes, security posture.
- **Non‑obvious trade‑offs**: performance vs. simplicity, cost vs. reliability, build/deploy changes.
- **Policy/process decisions**: coding standards, dependency management, migration strategies.

### Where ADRs live
- Create one ADR file per decision under `docs/alternative/pr/adrs/` using:
  - `YYYYMMDD-short-title.md` (e.g., `20250821-switch-to-sequelize-v7.md`)
- Keep this file (`architecture_decision_records.md`) as the canonical ADR process and template.

### Numbering and cross‑referencing
- Use the date-based filename as the identifier. Reference as `ADR-YYYYMMDD`.
- If superseding a prior ADR, link both ways:
  - New ADR: “Supersedes ADR-YYYYMMDD: <title>”
  - Old ADR: “Superseded by ADR-YYYYMMDD: <title>”

### Status values
- **Proposed**: Draft under review.
- **Accepted**: Approved and planned/implemented.
- **Rejected**: Considered but not chosen; keep for historical context.
- **Deprecated**: Still in use but planned for replacement.
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR (reference it).

### ADR workflow for this repo
1. Create a new ADR from the template below in `docs/alternative/pr/adrs/`.
2. Submit as a small PR with a focused scope; title starts with `ADR:`.
3. Discuss via code review. Update status when consensus is reached.
4. Implement changes in follow‑up PRs. Link PRs back to the ADR.
5. Keep the ADR updated during implementation (status, links, deviations).

### Writing guidelines
- Be concise but complete; optimize for future readers unfamiliar with current context.
- Record considered options and why the chosen option wins.
- Call out risks, roll‑back plan, and operational impact (monitoring, costs, security).
- Use clear headings and bullet lists for skimmability.

### ADR template
Copy the following into a new file under `docs/alternative/pr/adrs/`.

```md
## ADR-YYYYMMDD: <Short, imperative title>

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYYMMDD
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Owners: <name> (<@handle>), ...
- Tags: <domain>, <subdomain>

### Context
Explain the problem, constraints, users/use cases impacted, and any relevant background or prior ADRs.

### Decision
State the decision clearly. Describe the architecture/approach at a high level.

### Consequences
- Positive impacts
- Negative impacts / risks
- Operational considerations (observability, support, performance, costs)
- Security and privacy implications

### Options considered
- Option A: <summary>
- Option B: <summary>
- Option C: <summary>

### Decision drivers
- Driver 1
- Driver 2
- Driver 3

### Rollout and migration
- Phases / milestones
- Data migrations (backups first), fallbacks, and rollback plan
- Feature flags or config toggles

### Alternatives and why not chosen
Briefly capture why prominent alternatives were rejected.

### Links and references
- Related Issues/PRs: [#000](https://example.com)
- Supersedes: ADR-YYYYMMDD (if applicable)
- Superseded by: ADR-YYYYMMDD (if applicable)

### Example (brief)
```md
## ADR-20250821: Adopt centralized request logging

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-08-21
- Owners: Team Platform
- Tags: logging, observability

### Context
Services emit inconsistent logs; troubleshooting incidents is slow and costly.

### Decision
Adopt `pino` with a shared logger in `config/logger.js`, JSON output, request IDs via middleware, and ship to Loki in production.

### Consequences
- Improved traceability across services
- Slight overhead in dev; need dashboards and retention policy

### Options considered
- Keep ad‑hoc console logging (rejected: unstructured)
- Winston (rejected: heavier for our needs)

### Rollout and migration
Phase 1: add middleware; Phase 2: migrate services; Phase 3: dashboards

### Links
- Related PRs: #1234, #1240
```

### Maintenance
- Keep ADRs current with reality; update status and links when implementations change.
- Do not delete ADRs; they are historical records that explain “why”.
