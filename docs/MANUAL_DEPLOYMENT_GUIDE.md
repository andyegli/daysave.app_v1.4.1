# 🚀 Manual Deployment Guide

## ✅ Current Status
- **Professional migration fixes**: ✅ Applied and committed
- **Production mode**: ✅ App will skip auto-sync and use migrations only
- **Workflows enabled**: ✅ Ready for manual triggering

## 🎯 How to Trigger Deployment

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Actions
**URL**: https://github.com/andyegli/daysave.app_v1.4.1/actions

### Step 2: Look for Available Workflows
You should now see these workflows in the left sidebar:
- ✅ **"Full Staging Deploy"** (recommended)
- ✅ **"Manual Deploy Trigger"** (test workflow)
- ✅ **"Force Deploy"** (simple test)

### Step 3: Trigger the Deployment
1. **Click on "Full Staging Deploy"** in the left sidebar
2. **Look for "Run workflow" button** (should be visible on the right side)
3. **Click "Run workflow"**
4. **Select "develop" branch** (should be default)
5. **Click the green "Run workflow" button**

## 🔍 If You Still Don't See "Run workflow" Button

### Option A: Try Different Workflow
- Click on **"Manual Deploy Trigger"** instead
- This should definitely show the "Run workflow" button

### Option B: Check Repository Permissions
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Ensure you have admin/write access to the repository

### Option C: Direct URL Access
Try these direct links:
- **Full Staging Deploy**: https://github.com/andyegli/daysave.app_v1.4.1/actions/workflows/full-staging-deploy.yml
- **Manual Trigger**: https://github.com/andyegli/daysave.app_v1.4.1/actions/workflows/force-deploy.yml

## 🎯 What Will Happen When You Run It

### Expected Process:
1. **VM Creation**: Fresh VM with persistent storage
2. **Professional Migrations**: Database tables created properly
3. **Production Mode**: App starts without auto-sync conflicts
4. **SSL Setup**: Certificates generated
5. **Health Checks**: All services verified

### Expected Timeline:
- **Duration**: 15-20 minutes
- **Key Success Indicator**: Look for `🔧 Production mode: Skipping auto-sync, using migrations only`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If workflows are not visible:
1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub to recognize new workflows
3. **Try incognito/private browsing mode**

### If "Run workflow" button is missing:
1. **Check you're on the correct branch** (develop)
2. **Verify repository permissions**
3. **Try the "Manual Deploy Trigger" workflow instead**

## 📞 Next Steps
Once you trigger the workflow:
1. **Monitor the progress** in the Actions tab
2. **Look for our professional fixes** in the logs
3. **Wait for completion** (~15-20 minutes)
4. **Test the application** at https://daysave.app

The professional migration fixes are ready - we just need to trigger the deployment! 🚀
