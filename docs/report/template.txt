Executive Summary
Sample: In this project, I developed a web application to promote water safety in New Zealand. I used basic HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MYSQL, Node.JS and JavaScript to develop this app. This is a self-sponsored, individual project developed in an iterative manner. I created the Use Cases based on my personal knowledge and experience related to water safety. 

Introduction
Sample: The number of people who get into trouble, and even lose their lives, in water in Aotearoa New Zealand is quite high as a proportion of the population. We have a very long coastline and treacherous rip currents at many beaches. Not many people, especially recent migrants, are not aware of the dangers of rip currents.
I have personally seen many rescues and even helped people get to safety. I am aware that there is a national website (https://watersafety.org.nz/) that helps promote water safety in New Zealand but not many people seem to be aware of its existence or use it to educate themselves.

Reflection
Sample:
I started with very little knowledge in web app development. By doing this project I learned how to use basic HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MYSQL, Node.JS and JavaScript. I am aware that there is much more to learn. I also learned about Use Cases and improved my project and time management skills. The learning environment was good and collaborative with people helping each other.   

If I am to do this project or a similar project again, I will…………..
