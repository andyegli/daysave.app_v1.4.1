# API Security Sequence Diagram

## API Key Authentication and Security Flow

This document contains the sequence diagram for the API key authentication and security monitoring system in DaySave v1.4.1.

### System Components

- **User/3rd Party App**: External applications using DaySave APIs
- **API Gateway**: Main entry point for all API requests
- **Auth Service**: Authentication and authorization service
- **Database**: Data storage and key validation
- **Security Monitor**: Real-time monitoring and threat detection
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrative oversight and management

### Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User/3rd Party App
    participant API as DaySave API Gateway
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant DB as Database
    participant Monitor as Security Monitor
    participant Admin as Admin Dashboard

    User->>API: Request with API Key
    API->>Auth: Validate API Key
    Auth->>DB: Check key status & permissions
    DB-->>Auth: Key valid, permissions loaded
    Auth->>Monitor: Log authentication attempt
    Auth-->>API: Authentication success + permissions
    API->>API: Check route permissions
    API->>DB: Execute authorized request
    DB-->>API: Return data
    API->>Monitor: Log successful API call
    API-->>User: Return response

    Note over Monitor: Continuous monitoring
    Monitor->>Monitor: Analyze usage patterns
    Monitor->>Admin: Alert on suspicious activity
    Admin->>DB: Review audit logs
    Admin->>Auth: Disable compromised key if needed

    Note over User,Admin: Failed authentication flow
    User->>API: Request with invalid key
    API->>Auth: Validate API Key
    Auth->>DB: Check key status
    DB-->>Auth: Key invalid/expired
    Auth->>Monitor: Log failed attempt
    Monitor->>Monitor: Track failure count
    Monitor->>Admin: Alert on repeated failures
    Auth-->>API: Authentication failed
    API-->>User: 401 Unauthorized
```

### Security Features

#### **Real-time Monitoring**
- Continuous analysis of API usage patterns
- Anomaly detection for unusual request patterns
- Geographic monitoring for access from unexpected locations
- Rate limiting enforcement and violation tracking

#### **Audit Trail**
- Complete logging of all authentication attempts
- Detailed tracking of API key usage and performance
- Failed attempt monitoring with automatic alerting
- Administrative action logging for key management

#### **Threat Response**
- Automatic key disabling on suspicious activity
- Real-time alerts to administrators
- Comprehensive forensic logging for investigation
- Integration with security monitoring systems

### Implementation Notes

- All API keys are stored as bcrypt hashes in the database
- Rate limiting is enforced per key with configurable limits
- Failed authentication attempts trigger progressive security measures
- Administrative actions are logged and require proper authorization
- The system supports both automatic and manual key rotation
