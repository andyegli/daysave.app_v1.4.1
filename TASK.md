## Summary
The multimedia analysis integration is fully functional and production-ready. Users can submit multimedia URLs (videos, audio, and images), get automatic AI analysis, view results in enhanced UI with visual indicators, and access detailed analysis via modal. Videos get transcriptions and summaries, images get AI-generated descriptions and summaries, treating both equally in the content management workflow. The AI Analysis Modal features scrollable content, inline editing of summaries, copy-to-clipboard functionality, and comprehensive user feedback. All data is properly stored and linked in the database. The complete workflow from URL submission to AI-enhanced content display and management works successfully for all multimedia types with 4 new database tables, comprehensive API endpoints, and real-time UI updates.

**The subscription management system is now fully operational alongside the multimedia analysis system, providing complete business logic for user tiers, usage tracking, and feature access control.**
